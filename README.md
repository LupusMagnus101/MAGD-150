These projects are part of my labs from a P5.js JavaScript course. They demonstrate various techniques applied to achieve specific visual and interactive effects. This repository showcases my progress in learning the P5.js library and my journey through creative coding.

I plan to upload all the labs eventually, making this a valuable resource for finding inspiration and exploring ideas.
